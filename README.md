# Decentralised Voting App

This voting app aims to address the issue of fair and secure voting in a decentralized manner. By leveraging the power of the Ethereum blockchain, the app ensures that duplicate votes are not allowed and only authorized voters can participate in the voting process. Additionally, the app restricts the adding of candidates and voters to only the organizer, ensuring that the voting process remains transparent and fair. Overall, the app provides a secure and transparent way for organizers to conduct voting, while ensuring that voters have confidence in the fairness and accuracy of the results. By solving these key problems, this app has the potential to revolutionize the way voting is conducted in various settings, including elections, surveys, and decision-making processes.

This app also demonstrates a basic HartHat use case.
